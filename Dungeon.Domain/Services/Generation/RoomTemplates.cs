/// Legend: <c>.</c> floor, <c>#</c> wall, space: void (a pit), <c>o</c> barrel or jar,
/// <c>I</c> column, <c>=</c> railing, <c>g</c> sewer grate (walkable), <c>~</c> water,
/// <c>^</c> lava, <c>T</c> tomb (two or three side by side), <c>e</c> enemy spot,

/// <para>
/// Every template has odd dimensions, a walkable centre, and a walkable tile in the middle
/// of each side, where a corridor may arrive. The party climbs down a ladder in the middle
/// of the start room, so its centre is plain floor; the north wall of a boss room holds the
/// gate down, with a walkable tile below it. <c>RoomTemplatesTests</c> checks all of it.
/// The north side is the one seen from the front, so templates are only mirrored left to
/// right.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The templates live in one file per kind of room, in <c>Templates/</c>. A template is
/// listed in the file of its first kind; a combat room that can also stand empty carries
/// both kinds. Each has a <see cref="RoomRarity"/>: labyrinths and the like are rare.
/// Rooms come in every size, from 7 x 5 to 25 x 19, and in every shape: spaces around a
/// room's tiles (a diamond, a cross, a rotunda) are the void outside it. A wall inside a
/// room is never one tile thick: seen from the front, it would read as a flat slab.
